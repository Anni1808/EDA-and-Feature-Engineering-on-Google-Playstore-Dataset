# 📱 Google Play Store Analysis & Feature Engineering  
_Uncovering trends, patterns, and user preferences to understand what drives app success_

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Feature Engineering (FE)** on the Google Play Store dataset to identify what makes certain apps successful. The dataset includes over 10,000 apps with details like installs, ratings, reviews, and pricing. This analysis uncovers hidden trends and patterns that can guide business strategies or inform machine learning models.

## 🧠 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess app data
- Analyze install trends, ratings, reviews, and pricing models
- Visualize important insights across categories
- Engineer meaningful features for future predictive tasks

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Regular Expressions

---

## 📊 Key Explorations

- Most installed apps in top 5 categories
- Distribution of app ratings and reviews
- Free vs Paid app performance
- Category-wise install analysis
- Price and size trends across apps

---

## 🧪 Feature Engineering Performed

- Converted installs and price to numeric types
- Extracted log-scaled install feature
- Categorical encoding for app type (free/paid)
- Cleaned app size and rating inconsistencies
- Removed duplicates and handled missing values

---

## 📌 Insights & Learnings

- **Games**, **Productivity**, and **Communication** apps dominate installs
- **Free apps** outperform paid ones in user acquisition
- **Review count** strongly correlates with installs
- App **size and price** have limited influence on popularity
